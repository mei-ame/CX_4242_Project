# FairFare - Affordable Travel Planning Made Simple

FairFare is a travel planning tool designed to help budget-conscious travelers find affordable flights and accommodations without the influence of paid promotions. Unlike platforms like Expedia or Kayak, FairFare prioritizes transparency and personalization. Using data from Google Flights and Hotels APIs, FairFare applies the **Skyline Extraction Method** to filter and rank results based on your preferencesâ€”such as price, layovers, and amenities.

With FairFare, users can:
- Find the most cost-effective options for flights and hotels.
- Personalize results by prioritizing key features.
- Enjoy an intuitive interface for streamlined trip planning.

FairFare ensures that travel planning experience is affordable and hassle-free.
